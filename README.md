# BlueIT Forum

BlueIT is a forum website that anyone can talk, ask questions and communicate with others. The website is in "early access" and has a lot to add to. There is Thread 1 and Thread 2. You can talk and ask questions in both threads. There is a support page where you can ask questions about the website or users that are there if there will be any issues.
